Let’s add a new feature, called “QuickPlay”

This feature lets the user instantly search for any asset in their library (playlist, sound effect, atmosphere, etc.).

There are three ways to invoke it:
1. A keyboard shortcut (opt-⌘-Space)
2. A menu bar item (File > QuickPlay)
3. A search field in the Play View toolbar (top of the app)

When activated, the QuickPlay search field instantly gets keyboard focus. Search results appear below the field. Use standard UIKit.

The user can then tap any search result to instantly play it. It of course appears in the appropriate recent or bookmarked section if necessary.
